Finished project: Build an AI model to accurately detect lanes and count them from images.

We will need to get a dataset and create an AI model using differnt AI algorithms, most likely a CNN, to detect lanes in images and hopefully videos.

By the end of sprint 1, we should have all the data and python modules we think we would need imported and setup.
